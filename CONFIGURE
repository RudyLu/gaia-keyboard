The keyboard app uses large dictionary files for autocorrection. If we
include all the dictionaries we have, our builds become too large. So
the keyboard is configured at build time to include only the layouts
and dictionaries we need for a particular build.

Dictionaries live in gaia/keyboard/dictionaries and layouts are
defined in gaia/keyboard/layouts. Files are copied into this app, but
are not checked into github in this app.

We also configure the manifest.webapp file at build time, so the
manifest.template file here is what is checked in. manifest.webapp is
dynamically generated from that template file and should not be
checked in.

See gaia/build/configure-keyboard.js and the keyboard target in gaia/Makefile
